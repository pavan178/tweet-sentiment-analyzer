# Sentiment Analysis from Tweets üìù

In this project our goal is to build a robust text classifier capable of discerning the sentiment expressed in a text, leveraging a dataset comprising approximately 27,000 entries. We will split this dataset into an 80%/20% training/test split to ensure the effectiveness of our model.

In this template, you will find the foundation for implementing your text classifier. While some functions are provided, others await your ingenuity to complete. Refer to the instructions file NLP_Assignment_1_Instructions.pdf for comprehensive details on each question. Here's a brief outline of what you'll accomplish for each question:

## Question 1: Input and Basic Preprocessing (10 marks)
Prepare the dataset by performing basic preprocessing tasks to ensure cleanliness and consistency in the text data.

## Question 2: Basic Feature Extraction (20 marks)
Extract fundamental features from the text data, laying the groundwork for subsequent analysis and model training.

## Question 3: Cross-validation (20 marks)
Implement cross-validation techniques to assess the performance and generalization capabilities of your model.

## Question 4: Error Analysis (20 marks)
Conduct error analysis to identify patterns and areas of improvement for your sentiment analysis model.

## Question 5: Optimizing Preprocessing and Feature Extraction (30 marks)
Refine and optimize preprocessing and feature extraction methods to enhance the overall performance and accuracy of your model.
